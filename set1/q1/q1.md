Q1.JS DOM and HOF:
ans: Higher order functions in javaScript are functions that either take other function as argument or return a function as a result. HOFs can be very usefull when manipulating the DOM because they allow you to write more abstract and reusable code.

**Using Higher order Functions to manipulate the DOM**
To manipulate the DOM with HOFs, we can use common array methods such as `map`, `forEach`, `filter` and `reduce` 
which are themselves higher order functions. These function can be used to iterate over collections of DOM elements and apply transformations or actions to them.
