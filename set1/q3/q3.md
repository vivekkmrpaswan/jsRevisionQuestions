Q.Forms and Validations
ans: To validate an email input field in a form, we can use both HTML5 built-in validation and JavaScript for more control and customization. Using a regular expression (regex) is a common method for validating the formate of the email address.

**Using HTML5 Built-in Validation**
HTML5 provides basic email validation using the `type = "email"` attribute.
html
`<form>
    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
    <button type="submit"></button>
</form>`

**Using JavaScript and Regular Expressions**
To have more control over the validation process, we can use JavaScript along with a regular expression to validate the email format. Here is a step-by-step guide:

1. Define the Regular Expression:
`/^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/`

break-down of above expression:

`^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+` : The email's local part, which can contain letters, digits, dots, underscores, percent signs, and hyphens.

`@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+`: The domain name part, which must start with `@` and can contain letters, digits, dots, and hyphens.

`\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$`: The top-level domain (TLD), which starts with a dot and must contains at least two letters.

2. Implement JavaScript Validation:
